This repository contains the code of the model presented in *Competition in Media Systems and Voter Knowledge: An Agent-Based Model*

Abstract: 

*This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) that shows that variation in voter knowledge can in part be driven by competition among media outlets. Using a set of simple behavioral rules implemented by voters, parties and media outlets, the model predicts that stronger media competition increases political knowledge of quality-minded voters vis-a-vis motivated reasoners although aggregate differences are small. This is because these voters are most likely to consume news even when it is of low quality. Not only do these results contribute to a larger (empirical) debate about media competition and political knowledge, but the model also serves as a theoretical starting point for exploring these patterns further.*
